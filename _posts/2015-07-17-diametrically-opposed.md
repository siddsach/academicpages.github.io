During my first week here, I had a few loud arguments with my grandfather. They all revolved around roughly the same kind of thing; he criticized a particular group of people, whether it was Muslims or Westerners or Chinese people or atheists, and I protested. I hated boiling down some group to a singular mindset that one could artificially pick apart and undermine. But such is the reality in India. In a country with more ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and
spiritual diversity than almost any other place in the world (largely because of its size), it’s almost impossible to go through life without putting people in conveniently compartmentalized boxes. Of course, that isn’t unique to India.

Wherever one looks in the U.S., there is existential battle between the corporate mindset and the idealistic mindset. By talking to each group about the other, one would get the impression that the world is just an assortment of either evil or childish people. The idea that social work and finance, that development and business can work together is a concept that people fervently don’t believe. They attribute that divide to the idea that commercial values, like making money, and
a humanitarian values, like fighting for a particular group’s rights, are fundamentally irreconcilable. Nowhere is this more visible than the ideological melting pot that is an elite liberal arts college.

In some ways, they’re right. Different people pursue different things. Even if the result of improving people’s lives can be achieved with both, diametrically opposed values make it difficult for people to understand or even respect another person’s point of view. Nowhere is this more easily apparent than at an elite college. While siting at my dining table next to an Econ major and a Humanities major, it can either loudly or silently become clear that each person sees
the other as symbols of what they despise.

But what is not recognized is the compatibilities in these modes of thought. I have spent significant parts of my life in close quarters with both “types” of people. My boss sitting next to me chuckles about “impact” and tells me he is completely commercially minded, while he in fact works at a socially-motivated fund, and I have seen him more willing to believe in new approaches to development than many NGO leaders. Many of my friends proclaim their idealism to the rest of their
world, but the fact is a lot of them are elite members of elite communities aiming for elite careers like law or academia, and they are often way more disconnected with the realities of those without privilege than the self-made corporate Indians or Chinese I meet who work at Goldman Sachs. As with Muslims and Hindus or Grandfathers and Grandsons, the differences between the way these people see the world does not, no matter how many times they might try to convince you of it, make
their worldviews mutually exclusive. But because it has been so much simpler to pack boxes of stereotypes than to unpack packages of complexity, no one seems to see that.

When I sit at an Impact Investing fund in Mumbai working for people who seem to care about both efficiency and equity, I’ve realized at least one thing. I, and other members of my generation, can and should do better. We have the resources and exposure and inter-connectedness to bridge gaps between different “groups” of people. We can make compatible what was thought to be incompatible, and not doing so would represent a huge missed opportunity to improve all of human endeavor.
In this day and age, if we don’t understand the perspectives of others in career path as well as culture, it’s not because we couldn’t try, but because we didn’t.
