When someone asks me, “where are you from?”, no matter what place I say or how much effort I spend talking about my background I am always lying. The truth is, “where are you from?” is a misleading question. Technically, the question calls for a specific, but not too specific geographic location. In reality, that person is trying to get some understanding of your background and who you are, even though identity does not necessarily have anything to do with geographical location. Some of the
most stereotypically “American” people I’ve ever met have lived in Thailand, Jakarta, India, Singapore, London, Tunisia, and Switzerland, and some of the most globally minded people I’ve ever met live in an all-white town in Massachusetts.

Personally, I’ve spent 18 of my 19 years of life not knowing where I’m from. Whether it was my parents leaving the country their ancestors had lived in for thousands of years, or when I left my friends and cultural upbringing to go to a utopian rainforest, or when I left the velvet pillow of a Singapore expat life with my family to go live in the woods with cows and teachers, or when I left the closest relationships among peers I had ever made to go begin my adult life, I have
always been on the other side.

The funny thing is, I almost never looked back. My childhood was unique in that I had gotten used to leaving things behind for the next, better thing. I never stayed in one place long enough to really care about any concept of home. Now, though, that has seemed to change. As I am in Mumbai and I visit the Hospital in which I was born and spend time with my Grandmother poring over decades-old photos, I begin to feel something familiar in the air, in the smell, in the sounds. I find myself
missing something I can’t really describe, something I don’t even necessarily have direct experience with.

When I started a conversation with a Chinese couple I met far away from home in Delhi today, I remembered something. In Chinese, the word for home is the same as the word for family. Of course, family is a privilege and ties with one’s family are something that one is lucky to have. I, myself have had difficulties with all of my family at some time or another that have made it feel as if we are worlds apart. So the idea that home and family are intertwined is confusing, and one is tempted
to assign the idea to rigid Confusion structures of the archetypal nuclear familial unit. But it could also mean more.

One could also take it to mean that family and home, both, are what one goes back to(In chinese this is called “huijia”). Though for most of my life I have refused to admit it, my family has been my anchor, my support, my fallback, and though locations have never ceased to change, I have come to realize that I only say I’m going home when I go back to them. It is only with them that I feel like I have some direct knowledge of “home”. So I can sincerely say, right now that I really do
miss home, in a weird double meaning way. It’s good, despite being a little hipster-esque, because sometimes I need to remind myself that regardless of how confusing it is for me to introduce myself, I know where I’m from.
