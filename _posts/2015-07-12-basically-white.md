Today I met an American at my office. Though she was of Indian descent, in her words, she was, “basically a white girl,” who had never lived outside of America and did not speak a word of Hindi and called the ice cream people had brought, “like an Indian frozen yogurt.” (It was actually way better than froyo, despite her apparent longing for Pinkberry.) We had a wonderful conversation about philosophy and the role of women and the absence of conversation about non-binary gender in India,
but I realized as we spoke that a firmer and firmer bubble formed around us. Others could look in, but we did not look out. We were too absorbed in reveling in our American accents, our knowledge of the culture of other’s alma mater, and the comfort in not feeling like a foreigner for once. But for some unapparent reason, I felt deeply strange feeling like I was back in the States.

Of course, traveling is fun. Every week I’ve been here I’ve gone somewhere, sometimes for work, sometimes for seeing family, sometimes just to go. I repeatedly find myself enthralled by the things that everyone around me doesn’t seem to notice. The sheer terror of driving in Mumbai, the death-mongering contraption that is an Auto-rickshaw, the vibrancy of color, the endless ocean of people, the stark divide between the recently bought Mercedes parked adjacent to the recently flooded hut
that someone, somewhere calls a home. But aside from the adventure, escape, and amazement that going somewhere new brings, there is one thing that travelling is giving me more than anything else: perspective.

Now, here’s where I’m supposed to go into the post-modern, multicultural, relativist diatribe explaining the lessons of other cultures and the beauty inherent in what makes them unique. But that’s not what I’m going to do. Because while it’s easy to say that seeing another place taught me this, this, and this about their culture, it’s more controversial and difficult self-reflection that comes along with travelling, to acknowledge that in some ways, what I see and feel hear makes
what I experience normally seem strange, and even worrisome.

When I see how family so distant from me that they have never in their life seen me welcome me with warmer hospitality than the parents of those I’m closest to, I hesitate. When acquaintance after acquaintance seems to express the sincerest care in how I feel staying here alone when many of those who I have been closest to don’t have the time to respond to messages, I hesitate. It is not so much that I feel that Indian culture and people are so caring or hospitable; it is the realization
that, with no exception made for me, many of the Americans I know are not.

So as I sit alone in a plane to go to another new place to go to unintentional schools and meet unintentional teachers, I spend time reflecting. Now that I am at the halfway point of my time here, I can say with confidence that when I go back, it will feel different than I thought returning home would feel like. When people inevitably ask me about what all I saw, I will think this to myself (As of course if I say it out loud I’ll fall into the same Sid trap of again being a pretentious
contrarian): During those two months, I saw more of my own home than I did of India.
