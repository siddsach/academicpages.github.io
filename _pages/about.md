Read my recent [Earth Day Post](https://siddsach.github.io/posts/2020/04/earth-day/)!

## tl;dr for what I do:

* I am a data scientist in the bay area who's spent my career applying computational methods to problems that I care about. 
* Systems I've built in production have analyzed pests in millions of fish using computer vision and underwater cameras, directed hundreds of thousands of messages from patients to doctors for One Medical's telemedicine system, and classified and catalogued political opinions in news articles for hundreds of college kids for a startup I founded and got funding for in college. 
* Recently, I've been particularly interested in learning how to use data to enable vulnerable communities to adapt to climate change.
* Currently, I'm working on making fish farming more sustainable at Aquabyte. Aquabyte was featured by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels as a leading startup working on sustainability, check out the link below!

### Miscellaneous
* I've studied, worked, and lived in India, China, Singapore, New York, and rural Massachussets. 
* I have advanced proficiency in both written and spoken Mandarin and I speak and understand Hindi. 
* I'm an avid [world percussionist](https://youtu.be/qy-hhns3zlY?t=2919) my main instrument was Tabla, but these days I mostly jam on my [cajon](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKGypxdB_be/?taken-by=sid2968). I also write raps and freestyle sometimes, but I haven't put anything up yet.
