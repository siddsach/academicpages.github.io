# A Research Project Experimenting with Self-Attention to interpret different source domains for Transfer Learning 

Multi-task learning and transfer learning are set to change the way we do NLP, significantly improving model generalization, data efficiency, and accuracy. However, it's hard to interpret why knowledge particular datasets are more useful to transfer than others, and as we have [seen](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5jmj8/google-artificial-intelligence-bias), machine learning systems can unknowingly learn bias. To mitigate both of these problems, I'm experimenting
with using the recent method of attention to interpret different kinds of transfer learning.
